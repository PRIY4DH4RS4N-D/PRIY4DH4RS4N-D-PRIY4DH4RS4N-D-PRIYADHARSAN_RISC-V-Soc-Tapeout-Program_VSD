VSD RISC-V Tapeout Program – Document
Summary
Instructor: Kunal Ghosh (VSD - VLSI System Design)
Topic: RISC-V Tapeout Flow and SoC Integration
1. Chip Modelling & RTL Flow
O1: Specification (C Model)
• System specification is defined in C language.
• Testbenches are also written in C.
O2: RTL Architecture (Soft Copy of Hardware in Verilog)
• Hardware is described at RTL using Verilog.
• Processor + Peripherals/IPs are modeled in RTL.
O3: SoC Integration
• Integration of processor, peripherals, analog/digital IPs.
• Gate-level netlist generated after synthesis.
• Analog IPs and macros hardened as hard macros (HM).
ASIC Flow → Synthesis → RTL2GDS
• Steps include synthesis, floorplanning, placement, CTS, routing.
• Generates GDSII, which undergoes DRC/LVS checks.
2. Final SoC & Application
O4: Final Chip Realization
• SoC works at real frequencies (100–130 MHz).
• Same C testbench is reused for validation.
• O1 = O2 = O3 = O4 ensures consistency.
Applications & Boards
• iWatch (wearables).
• Arduino boards (development).
• TV panels (consumer electronics).
• AC applications (embedded controllers).
3. Key Takeaways
Unified C testbench ensures consistency.
SoC design flow: C spec → RTL (Verilog) → SoC → GDSII.
Verification at each stage ensures correctness.
RISC-V SoCs are applied in real consumer & industrial devices.
