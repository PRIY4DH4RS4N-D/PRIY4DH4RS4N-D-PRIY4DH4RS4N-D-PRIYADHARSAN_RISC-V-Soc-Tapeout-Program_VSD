The VSD RISC-V Tapeout Program, led by Kunal Ghosh, is an open-source VLSI training initiative that teaches end-to-end chip design. It covers the flow from C specification to RTL design, SoC integration, and final GDSII tapeout, using the Sky130 PDK and open-source tools, with applications in real-world devices.
