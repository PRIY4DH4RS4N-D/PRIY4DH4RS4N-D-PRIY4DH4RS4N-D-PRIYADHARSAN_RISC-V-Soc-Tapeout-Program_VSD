Welcome to my personal documentation of the **VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** journey!

This repository uniquely captures my **week-by-week hands-on experiences**, challenges, and insights as I progress through the full silicon realization flow — from RTL to GDSII.

<div align="center">

> *"Embarking on a silicon adventure! As part of India's largest open-source RISC-V tapeout initiative, I am building real chips and learning to bridge RTL logic with physical silicon, alongside 3500+ passionate engineers. This is my blueprint for deep-dive learning and nation-building through collaborative semiconductors."*
